# Titanic_Survival-Prediction

This project is a machine learning solution to the Titanic survival prediction problem using the *Naive Bayes algorithm. It includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)* with visualizations, *data preprocessing, **model training, and **evaluation*, and finally generates predictions on a test dataset.

## 📊 Demo Visualizations

The following plots were used to understand the data distribution:

- Survival count
- Survival by gender
- Survival by passenger class
- Age distribution by survival

These visualizations provided useful insights for feature engineering.

## 📁 Dataset

The datasets used are from the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) Kaggle competition:

- train.csv – used to train and evaluate the model
- test.csv – used to generate final predictions

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- *Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)* from Scikit-learn

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Features

- Data Cleaning and Encoding
- Exploratory Data Analysis with graphs
- Naive Bayes classification
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
- Final submission CSV generation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. *Clone the repository*:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/titanic-naive-bayes.git
   cd titanic-naive-bayes
